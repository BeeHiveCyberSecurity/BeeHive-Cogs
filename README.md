# The graveyard

This is where cogs go to die. For one reason or another, we're no longer interested in supporting their development.

# Cog list

### [Malcore](https://github.com/BeeHiveCyberSecurity/BeeHive-Cogs/tree/deprecated/malcore)
The Malcore cog was originally intended to let users take advantage of the Malcore API to perform reverse engineering-centric file and URL analysis tasks, thru Discord. 
We began furnishing this integration as a partner perk. Due to constant issues with API formatting and uptime, this wasn't a feasible cog to continue non-partner development of. 
When we chose to remove Malcore as a partner, the development of this outside from bug fixes was suspended, and now it finds its way into this graveyard.
If you see code here that could be useful to a project you're working on, feel free to be directly inspired.
